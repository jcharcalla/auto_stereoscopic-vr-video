# auto_stereoscopic-vr-video
This continer and script makes use of tools such as hugin and ffmpeg to automatically align and create top/bottom stereoscop vr video. I created it for use with my pair of Kodak pixpro sp360 4k cameras. It has the ability to output higher quaility video than the kodak software.

A sample video can be found here.
